      <description>This page contains links to recent or upcoming events and other activities and works of current interest to me.
Cardiff Online Analysis Seminar (CAOS): During the COVID-19 restrictions, Cardiff University has set up an online version of their analysis seminar: https://jbenartzi.github.io/seminars.html
(Related: a great number of online research seminars are listed here: https://researchseminars.org/)
Springer E-Books: Springer have recently released over 400 ebooks for free on line.

      <description>On this page I collected some small mathematical simulations that I coded as a hobby and that are nice to watch (choose from the menu). All simulations are implemented in basic Matlab or Python and the corresponding codes are freely available on Github.</description>

      <description>Periodically perforated domains Diffusion in a domain with periodically distributed obstacles can be macroscopically approximated by a reduced diffusion constant. This so-called homogenized constant can be computed numerically by solving an associated partial differential equation in a single periodic cell (the cell problem). The classical theory has been developed in this article.
I have implemented two different methods of computing the homogenized diffusion constant for obstacles of arbitrary shape. The figure shows the solution of the cell problem for a circular obstacle.</description>

      <description>Fit SIR model As part of my Python learning, I coded this little app, that generates simulated data of an infectious disease wave and then fits a simple SIR model. The user can choose between steepest descent and congugate gradient methods in a GUI.
The source code is openly available at https://github.com/frank-roesler/SIR_fit

      <description>Flatten the curve To illustrate the &amp;ldquo;flatten the curve&amp;rdquo; strategy against COVID-19, I&amp;rsquo;ve coded this little simulation in Python. Blue dots represent healthy individuals, red dots represent infected ones. Whenever a blue dot gets too close to a red dot, it gets infected (and infectious) for a certain period of time. Globally, this dynamic leads to a wave-like phenomenon.
The code is here: https://github.com/frank-roesler/Files/blob/master/Flatten_curve.py
  First video: bad situation with high peak;     Second video: good situation, where the peak has been flattened by increasing the average distance between the dots (compare the axis labels).</description>

      <description>Image reconstruction Example of Image reconstruction through inpainting using the heat equation. Initially, 97% of the image are lost. Using the remaining pixels as pinning points for a heat flow, one can recover a great deal of the information contained in the image.
The Matlab code is available at https://github.com/frank-roesler/Files/blob/master/Inpainting.m   </description>

      <description>Turing pattern Simple example of Turing pattern formation, coded in Matlab. Two solutions to a coupled PDE system compete until they reach a stable equilibrium. It is believed that this is the mechanism behind the formation of animal coat patterns.
The Matlab code is available at https://github.com/frank-roesler/Files/blob/master/Turing_FinDiff.m   </description>
